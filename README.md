# **Surfs-Up-Analysis**
## **Overview of the analysis:**
This analysis is conducted to assist the client in determining the feasibility of opening up a sustainable year-round surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. The reason client needs this analysis is to support his idea of this business and get a financial backing from an investor to get this idea off the ground, in addition to the savings he already have. This analysis is a part of his business plan to be able to provide relevant insights to convince the investor to support his business project. The investor is very much concerned about the weather conditions with respect to this business as he has already invested earlier in similar kind of surf shop but due to non consideration of weather conditions, that venture did not succeed and had to be closed. So, the investor has asked the client if he can present some weather analytics based on the weather data which he already has, for the very island where the client wants to open his surf and ice cream shop/business.

### **Purpose**
This particular analysis is conducted to provide more information to the investor about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He specifically wants temperature data to be analysed for th months of June and December. In this way, the investor would be able to decide whether the proposed business idea is sustainable year-round.
## **Results:**

From the Summary statistics obtained as above from the available data for the month of June and December, we have the following three major points of observation:
 - Average temperature for both the months, differs only by 3.9 units approximately.
 - The variation in maximum temperature is almost the same with just a difference of 2 units, for both the months.
 - The minimum temperatures vary for the months of June and December with 8 units with higher minimum temperatures in June as compared to lower minimum temperatures of December.

## **Summary:**

### **1. High-level summary for the results**
The results we obtained for the temperature observations for the months of June and December in our analysis present us the following insights which can be presented to the investor:

We have not much of a difference in average temperatures for the months and also the maximum temperatures vary with minimal values, which we can presume with confidence that we are looking forward to daytime temperatures on the basis of natural temperature values during the presence of sun.

And the minimum temperatures are surely during the night or presumable the times where surfing is none.

On the basis of above, we see that the months of June and December, where there is the maximum chances of huge variations in weather conditions normally in different parts of the world.But here,at this island, this analysis will inclines that these weather conditions on the basis of temperature observations,will allow surfers, surfing and warm temperatures for the ice creams and other stuff being sold at the shop.

Probably this is the most comfortable temperature in which to surf. The 80s can be uncomfortable and the 60s too cool, especially in the low numbers, but the 70s are just about right.

 ### **2. Additional queries to gather more weather data:**
 
 **a. June Precipitation Query**

The above two queries and the results in Summary would enable us to provide more insights into weather data for months of June and December.

We can clearly see from above that the maximum precipitation values differ by jus two units between these 2 months and hence almost similar precipitation as the other statistics data convey the similar observation.

Hence, we can see the overall weather conditions are favorable for the success of a surf and ice-cream business in Oahu.
